# Inclusion at XOXO

**This policy is a "living" document, and subject to refinement and expansion in the future. Last updated May 16, 2024.**

We want XOXO to reflect the diverse creative communities it celebrates. This policy serves as a list of our current inclusive production practices.


## Curation

XOXO prioritizes curating a diverse and representative lineup for our conference and festival events. We recognize our responsibility to amplify voices that have been traditionally marginalized both in our community and in society.

We pay all of our conference speakers and cover travel and accommodation for all speakers and performers.

Where relevant, we provide explicit content warnings for our conference talks and festival performances.

## Lottery

Registration for XOXO is offered through a survey and lottery process. A first-come, first-serve system typically favors those with time and money, which ends up benefiting predominantly those with well-paying jobs and disposable income.

Our survey system allows us to counter some of these biases, prioritizing access to the festival for underrepresented people and independent artists.

## Subsidized Passes

In past years, we were able to offer free passes to a small number of ​​economically disadvantaged attendees, subsidized by our patrons. This year, we’re unable to offer subsidized passes, but have cut the cost of all passes in half by reducing the scale of the event, hopefully making the festival accessible to more people.

## Health & Safety

All XOXO attendees, vendors, volunteers, and staff are required to wear a high-quality mask at all times while inside Washington High (including Revolution Hall, Show Bar, and common areas inside the venue), as well as at any festival event on our schedule where masks are required. 

Learn more about [our COVID policy](/guide/covid).

We offer sanitary products and toiletries (including menstrual products, sunscreen, makeup remover, cotton pads, dental floss, and deodorant) in all our restrooms. A first aid kit is also available at our registration desk.

Smoking is not permitted in any of our venues.

## Families & Childcare 

XOXO provides free on-site childcare for the duration of the event. We work with a Portland-based childcare service who provide experienced, background-checked childcare providers.

Children under 12 are welcome to attend XOXO free of charge, so long as they’re accompanied by a parent or guardian. Due to limited seating, a Theater Pass is required for all attendees inside Revolution Hall, even children. All of our venues are designated all-ages.

For more information, see our <a href="/guide/childcare">Childcare & Families</a> section.

## Identity

XOXO offers gender pronoun pins at registration. We encourage all attendees to wear a pin stating their pronouns.

Where possible, XOXO offers gender neutral restrooms. Where our venues have designated gendered restrooms, we display signage recommending that attendees should use whichever restroom they feel most comfortable with.

## Photo Consent

XOXO enforces a photo media consent policy for our attendees, designated by colored lanyards available at registration. 

A red lanyard designates strictly no photos or video, a yellow lanyard designates that photos and video are allowed with explicit consent, and a black lanyard designates that photos and video are allowed without permission.

## Hospitality

XOXO offers a curated menu of non-alcoholic drinks, coffee, and tea (including decaf) available throughout the event.

Our on-site food trucks offer a variety of vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free options.

Our bars also serve beer, wine, and cocktails. We ask our attendees to drink responsibly. Alcohol consumption is not an excuse for violating our [Code of Conduct](/guide/conduct).

## Vendors

XOXO prioritizes working with women and minority-owned businesses and vendors who prioritize diversity and representation in their teams.

## Location

XOXO takes place on the unceded, traditional Tribal lands of the Multnomah, Cascades, Clackamas, Oregon City Tumwater, Tualatin Kalapuya, and other Chinook bands who make their homes along the Columbia and Willamette rivers.
